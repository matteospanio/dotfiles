# dotfiles
These are my configuration files.

## i3 and i3 blocks
make sure to change all path of scripts and conf files, and make them executable.

## vim/nvim

- `.vimrc` is the old vimscript config file that should still work with vim, anyway it's no longer mantained because i switched to neovim

- `nvim` all nvim config are in `.config/nvim` folder, nvim~v0.8+ is required
